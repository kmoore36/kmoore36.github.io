	<h1>Hi! Welcome to my website!</h1>
		<p>This is a website written and built to give a bit of information on myself for a class assignment, and it 
		gives a bit of insight into my life and whatnot outside of the class and the assignments. The photos included 
		of my pets are taken by myself and my family, we keep too many pictures of our animals, but I hope you find 
		your way around okay!</p>
		<h2>Some small information on me:</h2>
			<ul><li><h3>I have several hobbies outside school.</h3></li>
				<p>I draw (mostly digitally), I enjoy writing stories, and I also stream on twitch in my spare time. 
				These are just some of my hobbies that I keep up with outside of schooltime and work.</p>
			<li><h3>I work for a cookie shop:</h3></li>
				<p>I work for a relatively popular chain cookie store in my off time, which has taught and continues 
				to teach me valuable lessons in management and customer service.
			<li><h3>I have 2 cats and a puppy:</h3></li>
				<p>The two cats are named with themes, Link and Zelda, and the puppy was named after Mad Max, and we 
				call him Maxy or Maximus Prime. I'm including photos of them below.</p>
